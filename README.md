# AGM33 - Beyond The Screen
This is a repository for my MA work on the AGM33 module. It can detect solid objects in an image, these can then be interacted with using a projector, and Leap Motion.
The JavaScript version is a simple game.

For the Python version it requires:
pygame, numpy, and opencv
